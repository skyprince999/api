# COVID19-India API


A volunteer-driven, crowdsourced database for COVID-19 stats & patient tracing in India

[https://github.com/covid19india/api](https://github.com/covid19india/api)

## Update [27 April]

Due to the growing size of the raw data, and the fact that regions like DL, MH, TG are only providing district level information, we have made a change in our data collection.
Now, raw data is available in three parts : 

`api.covid19india.org/raw_data1.json` (Data till EoD Apr 19th)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data2.json` (Data till EoD Apr 26th)<br>
`api.covid19india.org/raw_data3.json` (Live ðŸš€)<br>

Also, there are some structural difference in raw_data3.json : 
When a new report/bulletin is released from a state regarding confirmed cases : 
1. If patient level information is available (from several states like KA,KL,BH etc.), that is captured.
2. If only districtwise information is available, one row is entered for each district, and "numcases" field mentions the number of cases in that district
3. If only statewise information is available, one row is added added for the entire state (DL ðŸ‘€)

4. Recoveries and Deceased information is also available through raw_data3.json now. Use the "Current Status" field to extract that information.


All other aggregate APIs retain the same behaviour. 
CSV files for the same are also available through `api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/raw_data{n}.csv`


### JSON

|Status| Data                                                  | URL                                                   |

|:green_heart:| Patient Level : Raw Data Partition 3 (Live) | https://api.covid19india.org/raw_data3.json  |
|:green_heart:| National Level :Time series, State-wise stats and Test counts | https://api.covid19india.org/data.json                |

|:green_heart:| District Zones            | https://api.covid19india.org/zones.json  |
|:end:| Raw Data (Partition 1 + Partition 2. Frozen after Apr 26th) | https://api.covid19india.org/raw_data.json  |
|:end:| Deaths and Recoveries (Frozen after Apr 26th) | https://api.covid19india.org/deaths_recoveries.json |
|:end:| Travel history (No more updated)  | https://api.covid19india.org/travel_history.json  |

### CSV
Sometimes, having files in a spreadsheet format is more useful for analysts and scientists. We have provided the files as downloadable csv files in the following location.

| Data                                                  | URL                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Google sheets in CSV                                  | [https://api.covid19india.org/csv/](https://api.covid19india.org/csv/)                      |

> :rocket: Quick example : Apply the formula `=IMPORTDATA("https://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/state_wise.csv")` in A1 cell of a Google Sheets to get the state data for analysis :)

### Code to read the data using the API

```
# [Requires Python3.x]

from urllib.request import urlopen
import json
import pandas

url = "https://api.covid19india.org/raw_data3.json"
response = urlopen(url)
data = json.loads(response.read())
print(data.keys())

raw_data = pd.DataFrame(data['raw_data'])
print(raw_data.shape)
raw_data.head()
```

## How this works

- Data in this repository is generated from Google Sheets (https://api.covid19india.org/csv)
- Volunteers collect data from trusted sources and update the sheet
- This repo periodically fetches relevant data from the Sheet and create/update static json/csv.
- We use Github Actions to fetch the data periodically and auto-commit. Thank you @Github :)


## Contributing

- Contributions to new data formats are welcome. Please create a GH issue and discuss there before working on the same.
- Please raise an issue before submitting a PR
- Report issues with regarding [covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org) website in the [react-site repository](https://github.com/covid19india/covid19india-react/issues)
- DO NOT change anything in `gh-pages` branch directly.They get replaced automatically

## Notes
- Do not use the "Current Status" in raw_data.json as we are rarely able to map the status to the exact patient anymore. This will soon be deprecated in a future version of the API.
